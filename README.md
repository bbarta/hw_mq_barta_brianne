1. [Media Queries Using a Single CSS Stylesheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onxJ7lFPfqk)
I tried to solve my problems by watching this video, but since we had multiple widths defined for each device, I was even more confused and unsuccessful. 

2. [CSS3 Media Queries](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp)
I tried to use this as a starting point to see if it spoke to stylesheet implementation, but mostly internal CSS was demonstrated, so I didn't have much luck here. 

3. [Introduction to Responsive Web Design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/responsive/introduction-to-responsive-web-design-pseudo-elements-media-queries)
I was hoping this article would start from the beginning and explain more of adding the media queries within the link tag inside the index.html head tag. It scratched the surface for me.

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
I really, really struggled with this. I was trying to figure out how to link my index page to my main.css and to have all the different screen sizes apply. My only solution was to do multiple stylesheets, which I think are still working fine, but are obviously not ideal. I'm really looking forward to seeing the video demonstration of how this is done because I've felt really lost :(
